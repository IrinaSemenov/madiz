MADIZ project is aimed to develop a simple method and software to use conventional camera as a Radiation detector. MADIZ is intended but not limited to be installed on satellite Paspberry Pi computer with camera attached. Standart camera silicon matrix is sensetive to radiation abundunt in space, hence can be used for radiation detection. This code also may be useful for devepment of software radiation detectors for smartphones.

The project name, acronim MADIZ stands for MAtrix Detector of radiation (IZluchenii).
